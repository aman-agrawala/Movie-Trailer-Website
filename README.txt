This file explains how to generate the "Fresh Tomatoes Movie Trailers" website. The required files are: 1. entertainment_center.py, 2. fresh_tomatoes.py, 3. media.py. Without all three files, the website will not generate. The instructions in this readme assume you have some introductory knowledge of python in order to generate your own movie lists and it assusmes that python has been installed on your computer. To learn python, use the "Programming Foundations with Python" course from Udacity. For reference on installing python: https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Download.

Instructions for generating website:
1. Open the entertainment_center.py file in a plain text editor (ex Sublime, notepad, notpad++, etc) and not a rich text editor (Microsoft Word).
2. Add/remove any movies. In order to add a movie, call the movies class from the media file and provide, in the following order: 1. Title, 2. URL to the movie poster, 3. URL to the movie trailer, 4. the movie's 
   description,	5. the movie's release date, and 6. the movies IMDB Rating. 
3. Next add/remove the name of the movie's variable from movie_list. If the variable is not in the list, then the movie will not be displayed in the website.
4. Finally, double click on the entertainment_center.py file and the website should display in your default browser. If it doesn't, then open entertainment_center.py file in IDLE and run it. This should display the file.
